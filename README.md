# Draw_Something


The main idea is that I want build a website game like "Drawing Something", there will be mutil players and one hoster can draw something the according the words that get from datebase randomly, and also only hoster can see the words. and others players can guess what is the words according the drawing, once someone guess the words correctly, game over.
